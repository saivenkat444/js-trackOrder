//lets have a structure that tells me the order id when order placed (can be a number) 
//food preparaion should tell me the food itself (it can be an array)
//pack the food and tell me the packaging details(can be a string)
//delivery details should be added at last (can be object {name, address, time})
//want to handle them separate and then combine together to get the data log 
//get the start time first, then for every process calculate the time elapsed 
//for the whole process just add the times elapsed for the processes.
